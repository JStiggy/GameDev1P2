There once was a monster called the Bookwyrm.
His home was a library and he was never happier than when sharing his books with visitors.
Unfortunately, the new librarian keeps trying to him out… 
…But the Bookwyrm just sneaks back in for more books when her back is turned.
You got all your books back!
